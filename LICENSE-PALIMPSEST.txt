## Why Palimpsest?

A **palimpsest** is a manuscript page where the original text has been effaced to make room for later writing, but traces of the original remain visible. This license embraces the idea that:

- Software evolves through layers of contribution
- Each layer should honor those beneath it
- Attribution creates a visible history
- The past informs the present

## Rationale

The Palimpsest License adds **ethical guidelines** to the permissive MIT License while maintaining compatibility with open source principles. It asks users to:

- **Think about impact**: Consider how software affects people
- **Act responsibly**: Use freedom wisely
- **Build community**: Contribute to collective benefit
- **Honor history**: Acknowledge those who came before

## Version History

- **v0.8** (2024): Initial public version with ethical use clauses
- Future versions will be backward-compatible where possible

## Alternative

If the Palimpsest License doesn't suit your needs, you may use the Software under the **MIT License** alone (see LICENSE file).
