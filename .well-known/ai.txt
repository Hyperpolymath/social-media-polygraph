# AI Training and Usage Policy

## AI Training Restrictions

**Machine Learning Training**: RESTRICTED

This repository and its contents are **NOT available for use** in training machine learning models, large language models (LLMs), or other AI systems, except under the following conditions:

### Permitted Uses

1. **Open Source AI Models**: Models released under OSI-approved open source licenses
2. **Academic Research**: Non-commercial academic research with proper attribution
3. **Fact-Checking AI**: AI systems specifically designed for fact-checking and misinformation detection
4. **Accessibility Tools**: AI systems that improve accessibility for people with disabilities

### Prohibited Uses

1. **Commercial LLM Training**: Training closed-source or commercial AI models
2. **Code Generation**: Training models for automated code generation without attribution
3. **Surveillance**: Training models for mass surveillance or profiling
4. **Deepfakes**: Training models for synthetic media generation
5. **Manipulation**: Training models designed to manipulate or deceive users

## Ethical AI Principles

We support AI development that:

- **Respects Attribution**: Properly credits original authors
- **Promotes Transparency**: Discloses training data and model behavior
- **Ensures Accountability**: Provides recourse for harm caused by AI
- **Protects Privacy**: Respects user privacy and data rights
- **Avoids Bias**: Actively works to reduce algorithmic bias
- **Serves Public Good**: Prioritizes societal benefit over profit

## AI-Assisted Contributions

We **welcome** contributions assisted by AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) under these conditions:

1. **Disclosure**: Note in PR description if AI tools were used
2. **Review**: Human review and understanding of all AI-generated code
3. **License Compliance**: Ensure AI-generated code doesn't violate licenses
4. **Quality Standards**: AI-assisted code must meet same quality standards
5. **Attribution**: If AI suggests substantial code from other projects, attribute properly

## Data Usage by This Project

This project itself uses AI/ML for:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Entity extraction, sentiment analysis
- **Fact-Checking**: Claim verification and credibility scoring
- **Content Analysis**: Text complexity and bias detection

We commit to:

- **Transparency**: Document all models used
- **Privacy**: Not training on private user data
- **Opt-Out**: Users can request their data not be used for model improvement
- **Open Models**: Prefer open source models when possible

## AI-Generated Content Policy

Content generated by AI in this repository:

1. **Documentation**: AI may assist in writing docs, but human reviewed
2. **Code**: AI may suggest code, but must be understood by contributor
3. **Tests**: AI-generated tests welcome if they add value
4. **Issues/Comments**: AI-generated spam will be removed

## Enforcement

Violations of this policy:

- **First Offense**: Request to cease and desist
- **Repeated Violations**: Legal action under applicable copyright law
- **Good Faith**: We recognize detection is imperfect and will engage constructively
