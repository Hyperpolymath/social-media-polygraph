# Social Media Polygraph

## Project Overview

Social Media Polygraph is a tool designed to analyze and verify the truthfulness of content shared on social media platforms. The project aims to help identify misinformation, verify claims, and provide users with reliable fact-checking capabilities.

## Project Status

This is a new project currently in the initial setup phase.

## Technology Stack

To be determined. Common approaches for this type of project might include:
- **Backend**: Python (for ML/NLP), Node.js, or similar
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, or similar web framework
- **ML/AI**: Natural language processing, fact verification models
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar
- **APIs**: Integration with social media platforms and fact-checking services

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific best practices and style guides
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Aim for meaningful test coverage

### Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format when possible
- Create feature branches for new development

## Key Features (Planned)

1. **Content Analysis**: Analyze social media posts for potential misinformation
2. **Fact Verification**: Cross-reference claims with reliable sources
3. **Source Credibility**: Evaluate the reliability of information sources
4. **User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for checking content
5. **API**: Programmatic access for integration with other tools

## Dependencies

To be determined as the project develops.

## Setup Instructions

Setup instructions will be added as the project structure is established.

## API Integration

Potential integrations:
- Social media platforms (Twitter/X, Facebook, etc.)
- Fact-checking databases
- News APIs
- NLP/ML services

## Data Privacy & Ethics

Important considerations for this project:
- Respect user privacy
- Handle social media data responsibly
- Avoid bias in fact-checking algorithms
- Provide transparent reasoning for verdicts
- Follow platform terms of service

## Known Issues

None yet - project is in initial setup phase.

## Future Enhancements

Ideas for future development:
- Real-time monitoring of viral content
- Browser extension for in-context fact-checking
- Mobile applications
- Multi-language support
- Machine learning model improvements

## Resources

- [Fact-checking best practices]
- [Social media API documentation]
- [NLP libraries and tools]

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines will be established as the project matures.

## Notes for Claude

When working on this project:
- Prioritize accuracy and reliability in fact-checking features
- Consider ethical implications of automated fact-checking
- Focus on transparency in how verdicts are reached
- Ensure code is well-tested, especially for core verification logic
- Consider scalability from the start
- Be mindful of API rate limits for social media platforms
